        "problemStatement" : "How Red Bull can use social media?\r\n\r\nEvery company that wants to create a successful marketing campaign needs a social media presence and Red Bull knows that. Red Bull Media House is a great company but you also need social media content, communication, and a social media strategy.\r\n\r\nTheir strategy is ingenious but at the same time simple:\r\n\r\nFirst, they trigger consumer engagement through inspirational videos and activities.\r\nThese activities lead to videos and images that sometimes become viral. However, the brand is always prominent.\r\nThe next step is to create brand recognition through logo saturation and of course, clever product placements during sports events.\r\nThe result is widespread brand recognition and loyalty among a specific demographic group followed by new campaigns that aim to other groups as well.\r\nThrough their media companies, they produce content.\r\n\r\nWhat about their presence on social media? What types of content do they share with their fans and customers?",
