I was one of his direct reports, and I worked with him regularly in his role as team Tech Lead.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed working with and learning from Stephen. He's an extraordinarily capable engineer, with a deep understanding of LAMP administration, Site Reliability Engineering, and scaling up a production cluster. In addition, he's a very capable tech lead, for two reasons:\n\nFirst, he has what I can only call excellent taste in technology choices, and lead several projects that made life on the Operations team much better. Second, he's a gifted and experienced teacher and mentor. He's mentored several ops engineers on the team, including myself. I want to stress this, because finding effective mentors and teachers in this industry is exceptionally rare. Every question I asked him was answered charitably, with either a clear, specific, in-depth explanation, or a quick \"That's a great question! I don't know. Give me a minute.\"\n\nI feel lucky to have worked with him. I learned much and would welcome the opportunity to work with him again."

As I stumbled (and fumbled, and tripped) may way through that first month, the thing that stands out the most is how Daniela -- an exceptionally competent, elegant, and proficient dancer -- was able to not just meet me half-way, but well past that to where I stood (or landed) at the time.\r\n\r\nNow, almost two years later, I can't recommend her guidance, support, and teaching talent enough. I've gone from a graceless klutz to someone who gets compliments from long-time tango dancers on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nAll you need is a willingness to learn. Daniela's experience, wisdom, and knowledge will provide the raw material to learn from.\r\n\r\nA parting warning: Her passion, enthusiasm, and love of the dance is contagious."
