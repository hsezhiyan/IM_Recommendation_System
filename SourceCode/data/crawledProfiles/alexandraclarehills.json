As an educator, Nick was enthusiastic and prepared, and our 3 hour class flew by every week. His experience in the field provided his students a unique learning opportunity and his assignments were thought provoking and relevant to today's marketing world. As a mentor, Nick offered invaluable career advice and made the time to talk through my individual career goals with me. I was very lucky to be apart of Nick’s class and I walk away with skills and knowledge that not only helped me as a student, but also help me as a graduate of Boston University. Thank you Nick!\n…\nSee more"
