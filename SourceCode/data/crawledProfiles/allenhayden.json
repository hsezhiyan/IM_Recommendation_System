      "description": "I have a somewhat broad technical background both in computer science, machine learning, and biology. Coming up with novel solutions for clients utilizing various combinations of C/C++, Perl, Python, Apache, Linux, and Oracle/MySQL is what powers my life.\n\nLikewise, my subject matter experience is also fairly diverse having worked on projects ranging from oil exploration to advertising technology to satellite imagery to computer vision to medical devices.\n\nAlthough I'm quite capable of designing a full platform whatever I create is generally high transaction (especially for AdTech clients) so my backends are always full of high performance multi-threaded routines with an abundant use of shared memory and message queues. In short, spending a weekend trying to get query response times down to 1/10,000th of second is commonplace.\n\nFor most projects, I'm often tasked with creating an entire turnkey platform or engine from design and testing all the way through going live and then spending the last week or so writing up documentation for hand-off to the clients inhouse dev staff.\n\nI'm professional, down to earth, and always go the extra mile to help my clients feel not just comfortable but excited about their decision to work with me. Getting a 4am email about some idea that's had me in the zone pulling an all-nighter with a cold pizza box nearby is pretty much part of my creative DNA :)\n\nI can't talk about most projects but I've included a small sampling below that might be worth a quick skim to see if I'm a good fit for a potential client. If you have questions just let me know.\n\n**Got a project or decently funded startup that might change the world? Definitely give me a call. I'm always eager to help make the world a better place!\n\n\n…\nsee more",
