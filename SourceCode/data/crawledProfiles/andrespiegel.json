Andre was a Senior Technical Consultant who came in some of my more strategic accounts and helped bring clarity to and solve challenging situations and complex problems (usually when customers wanted to push the limits of the software and endeavor to introduce another layer or two of complexity to a proposed grid computing solution design). I was very impressed with Andre's demeanor and very humble, transparent and honest (genuine) approach to his work. Most of all, the level in which my customers trusted him was very remarkable due to this approach. I learned a great deal from Andre by having the opportunity to observe him during many calls and meetings. I would consider it an honor to work with him again. I believe one of the unique qualities of Andre that makes him quite a valuable individual is that he possesses an infinite curiosity about whatever he sets his mind to accomplishing - and is very \"open minded\". He then applies that curiosity to productively and efficiently solving very challenging problems in an elegant way.\n…\nSee more"
