In addition to pioneering a TAZZ flavor of a COM related object management framework, Andrew has been instrumental in providing critical classes used in development such templatized mutexes and signalling solutions, ref counted pointer implementations, and other fairly complex template based developer tools. As a senior software engineer, Andrew can be considered a master of the C++ language and the Unix environment. Additionally, Andrew has well rounded experience in scripting and build environments and should be considered a first choice candidate when deciding on a new member of a team. His dedication to quality, extremely strong work ethic, and vast knowledge of OO concepts sets him apart from the rest of the playing field hands down.\n…\nSee more"
