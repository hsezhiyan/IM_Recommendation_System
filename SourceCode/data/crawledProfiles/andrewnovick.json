We set out our greatest challenges before him, and his questions and recommendations exemplified his understanding of the entire ecosystem that SQL applications are built upon. Still, I would not recommend someone based on this alone - Andrew is commendable for the results he achieves through effective implementation of his skills. I personally think of Andrew as something of a combination 'code ninja' and workhorse. As someone who does similar work day in and out, I was truly impressed with the sheer volume of very high quality work he was able to produce. Finally, Andrew will ensure you understand all that you need (or want) to know about what he has done for you, complete with concise documentation. While the project we worked with Andrew on was very SQL-centric, Andrew is surprisingly adept with a number of technologies. If you have a true challenge before you, call Andrew first.\n…\nSee more"
