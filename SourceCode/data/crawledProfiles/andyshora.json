During my time there I designed and developed the world’s first end-to-end secure email client in JavaScript/HTML5 (http:// www.privatesky.me), using elliptical curve cryptography for data encryption and message signing and verification.\n\nI enabled the encryption of files over 500MB in-browser via pushing the capabilities of HTML5 web workers to the limit, so encryption is ‘chunked’, queued, and processed via 3 asynchronous workers so even web browsers on slow computers didn’t experience browser lockup.\n\nThe encryption libraries were developed by Professor Mike Scott, which I became educated and familiarised with. I helped port them to JavaScript by working with libraries developed by Stanford University, oversaw compatibility testing with Managed C++ and C# libraries, and finally made sure their integration with the UX in an email client was as seemless as possible. The ported libraries surpassed benchmarks achieved by Stanford libraries, and the additional functionality achieved with HTML5 web workers allowed me to produce an enterprise-level solution to encrypting email attachments.\n\nI also developed compatibility testing tools, for example, to make sure a message encrypted on iOS could be decrypted in a web browser in JavaScript. Other notable projects included designing and developing company dashboards to display product usage and sales metrics, in HTML5, CSS3 and .NET (C#) backend, connecting to an API interfacing the MongoDB datastore.\n…\nsee more",

He brings not just technical and visual skills, but he really is a top bloke and extremely fun to work with."
