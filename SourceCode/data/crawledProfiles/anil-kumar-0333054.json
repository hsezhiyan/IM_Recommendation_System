My specialization in computer architecture with electrical engineering background and proven record of delivering and working across enterprise customers have complemented my skills of team building and leading in futuristic unchartered opportunities.\n\nNow, I am looking for a role to continue to learn about new technologies in enterprise and cloud as well as strategically enabling ecosystems to leverage latest SW and HW technologies for optimal performance and maximizing ROI (Return on Investment). My passion is to lead projects involving diverse groups working on performance analysis including developing tools, benchmarks, methodology etc. and best of all, wrapping my mind around huge amount of performance data and analytics.\n\nAs chair of the Java committee at SPEC, I have successfully lead teams to derive benchmarks where competing companies have divergent views and end goals. This committee is responsible for all Java benchmarks at SPEC and has released one of the most popular Java benchmark SPECjbb*. I have also represented Intel at Java JCP Executive Committee responsible for future enhancements.\n\nI have played very effective role of Java Evangelist at various industry forums like JavaOne, SouJava Brazil and Java User groups. I have delivered several presentations and keynotes about the role of Intel in Java as well as Java Optimizations on IA. During last three years I have managed runtimes .NET for one year and later scripting language runtimes team with special responsibility for Node.js by establishing Intel as one the core members of Node.js community. In addition, playing important role in understanding emerging containers and FaaS (Function as a Service) where Node.js is key."

    "summary": "Over the years, I have traversed unique path in runtimes optimizations, performance, and scaling, open source, leading standards, architecting benchmarks, understanding and influencing emerging ecosystems as well as enterprise production environments of bare-metal and cloud. My specialization in computer architecture with electrical engineering background and proven record of delivering and working across enterprise customers have complemented my skills of team building and leading in futuristic unchartered opportunities.\n\nNow, I am looking for a role to continue to learn about new technologies in enterprise and cloud as well as strategically enabling ecosystems to leverage latest SW and HW technologies for optimal performance and maximizing ROI (Return on Investment). My passion is to lead projects involving diverse groups working on performance analysis including developing tools, benchmarks, methodology etc. and best of all, wrapping my mind around huge amount of performance data and analytics.\n\nAs chair of the Java committee at SPEC, I have successfully lead teams to derive benchmarks where competing companies have divergent views and end goals. This committee is responsible for all Java benchmarks at SPEC and has released one of the most popular Java benchmark SPECjbb*. I have also represented Intel at Java JCP Executive Committee responsible for future enhancements.\n\nI have played very effective role of Java Evangelist at various industry forums like JavaOne, SouJava Brazil and Java User groups. I have delivered several presentations and keynotes about the role of Intel in Java as well as Java Optimizations on IA. During last three years I have managed runtimes .NET for one year and later scripting language runtimes team with special responsibility for Node.js by establishing Intel as one the core members of Node.js community. In addition, playing important role in understanding emerging containers and FaaS (Function as a Service) where Node.js is key."
