He was devoted to building a strong team and keeping them motivated despite a few changes in priorities in a short period in time. He was decisive, strategic, and a strong technical leader.\n…\nSee more"

There are many types of developers and only two types of bosses. As a developer Ben is meticulous in his process and deeply responsible in his actions. As a boss thankfully he takes the high road and has the maturity to guide his team with gravitas, that both facilitates and promotes each team member to feel proud of the work they have achieved. This is a rare talent in a boss these days. So thank you for your guidance and leadership. It goes without saying I fully recommend Ben to any company who wants a skillset of this level. I hope our paths will pass again in the future.\n…\nSee more"

When the service was not so helpful, he could still mantain the UI with the ideal and reusable contracts and components by driving the UI with separate layers. Not only Ben was able to solve every problem we came across, he managed to do so in a manner that was elegant and forward thinking. He is a strong proponent of best practices and it shows in the quality of his code. Ben is a great person as well and I would not only consider him as the best developer, but a friend.
