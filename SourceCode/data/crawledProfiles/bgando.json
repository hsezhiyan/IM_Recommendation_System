Not only does Bianca know her JavaScript extremely well but she is also a great public speaker. It's definitely not easy standing in front of a bunch of smart people from diverse backgrounds that you've never met before, all while attempting to teach them about complex subject matters such as Closure and Recursion. Bianca explained things in a clear and concise manner and made herself more than available for help during and after class. Her initial explanations were so good, in fact, that I actually didn't end up having too many questions. This says a lot considering that I was exhausted from a full day of work and commuting to the city from Los Gatos for her workshop. Bianca was asked a few questions by students that were pretty conceptual in nature; I thought for sure she would be stumped. Nope. She handled the questions with ease. You would only be able to answer challenging questions like this on the fly if you truly understood the nuts and bolts of the topic you were teaching. Bianca knows her JavaScript! I struggled with a few of the coding exercises she provided(these were great by the way) and she was more than happy to guide me down the proper path. If Bianca is representative of all the instructors at Hack Reactor than it is readily apparent why everyone wants to attend this school. This is my first experience with Bianca and Hack Reactor. Very impressed.\n…\nSee more"

I assist and co-teach with Bianca at the Hack Reactor JavaScript Algorithms meetup and the Hack Reactor Junior classes, specifically JavaScript Fundamentals 2. She has broad and deep knowledge of object oriented JavaScript, Functional JavaScript and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. Being educated at Harvard and Stanford and having worked in education I have a wide basis of comparison for 'instructor quality' and I can say with a clear conscience that Bianca ranks in the top 5% of all instructors I have encountered. Among other great qualities she is a great trouble shooter: it takes both deep technical understanding, technical experience as well as empathetic skills to drill down and find each participant's point of confusion and clarify it, and Bianca excels at this. As a lecturer and instructor, Bianca is very well prepared, professional in her presentations, Q&A and code reviews. She manages the classroom with ease, giving attention to each participant. I particularly enjoyed her explanation of closures and object instantiation patterns as well as the expertise with which she can break down complex topics and present them simply. Finally, I must admit that it was the positive atmosphere that she creates in each and every event which has made me apply to Hack Reactor. She is a true asset to any technical organization, and we can all learn a great deal from Bianca.\n…\nSee more"

He is very comfortable explaining complex ideas in ways that are beginner friendly and his demeanor is welcoming and patient. He is able to foresee potential confusion which was invaluable when creating programming challenges for the class to address different angles of a concept. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, he is always looking out to add value and help others by sending follow-up resources. His positivity and enthusiasm for coding is contagious. I have learned a lot from him and am looking forward to our continued collaboration in future JS Fundamentals classes."

I have taught at least 100 people JavaScript in the past year and he learned twice as fast as anyone I have ever taught before. Because of this, I asked him to TA some of the classes I teach and within a short time, he was co-teaching alongside me. \r\n\r\nSecondly, I want to highlight his people skills. Albrey immediately connects with people whether it is a server at a restaurant, a teenager from a YMCA program or the students in my JavaScript Fundamentals class. He is engaging in front of a crowd and is a clear communicator for complex concepts. He is an incredible asset to our community and classroom."
