He did all this while working with clients who were often \"strong cups of coffee,\" as they say. He always delivered results and he always exceeded client expectations. Grace under pressure.

Brady had some talented bass students playing in the jam so I reached out for some bass lessons. Having been self taught prior I was hoping for structure in practice, breaking bad habits, and to start playing some cool grooves. He has helped me with that and more. He has shown me how to plan my practice time for song work, technique, and reading/theory. He also strives to understand the music styles and artists I enjoy and helps with song breakdown so I can get to playing what I love. Artistically, Brady is a great musician. Both his playing and writing show the mastery he has worked hard to achieve over the years. He has many styles he plays with a real groove and zest. It has always given me confidence that his range in music is wide and deep for teaching in our lessons. I feel real fortunate learning from Brady and to know him as a kind and thoughtful person.\n…\nSee more"

My wife bought me four lessons with Brady as a gift. I walked into my first lesson very nervous and way out of my comfort zone. I literally knew nothing about the instrument I was holding. Because of Brady those first four lessons changed my life. Brady is a very skilled bassist. He is also a very good teacher and one of the nicest and most patient people you will every meet. I highly recommend that any person, at any age, with any amount of experience seeing Brady for bass guitar lessons. I continued with Brady well after those first four lessons. Now I am a bassist in a rock band playing venues around Seattle. I owe it all to Brady and those first four lessons.\n…\nSee more"
