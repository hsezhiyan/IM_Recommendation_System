As part of that I work on compilers, runtimes, and libraries to support all of Google's C++ developers, helping them write better code more easily.\n\nI also lead Google's LLVM team, the primary team using and contributing to LLVM, Clang, LLD, and the various other parts of the LLVM project.\n\nI help represent Google's interests on the ISO C++ Standards Committee. I also speak at a wide range of conferences to help spread awareness of modern C++, programming tools for C++ developers, compilers, and optimizers. My mission is for C++ programmers everywhere to be able to easily write, debug, and maintain efficient and elegant code on the platform of their choice.\n…\nsee more",

Since 2011 I have been contributing significantly to LLVM both as part of my job at Google and in my own time.\n\nI'm responsible for the current inline cost analysis, scalar replacement of aggregates, and code layout in LLVM. I have worked heavily on address mode matching for x86, loop pass structure, the canonicalization passes, the reassociate pass, and the profile weight modeling infrastructure.\n\nI'm in the process of rewriting the core pass management infrastructure of LLVM to enable more powerful inlining, profile guided optimizations, and LTO.\n…\nsee more",
