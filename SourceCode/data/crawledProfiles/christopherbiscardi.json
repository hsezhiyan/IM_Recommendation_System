Chris was able to come in and help us completely change what we had so that it was a more modern stack, and it is still the basis for what is getting used today. He helped me hire other front end developers to build out our front end team, and lead in the creation of a common frontend toolset and framework which is still used today. Since I wasn't a front end developer, and I didn't stay up to date on all the day to day advances, I was able to count on Chris to keep me informed on what was going on, and to make sure we were not doing something wrong. I really liked working with Chris, and I hope I get a chance to work with him again in the future.\n…\nSee more"
