I was pretty much impressed by the depth of knowledge he possesses in Java/J2EE environment. Later on in 2007, I when I started attending the Central Ohio Java User Group (COJUG) seminars, came to know about him as the COJUG facilitator. There I became aware of his amazing breadth of knowledge as well. He is also an ardent initiator and supporter of J2ME and iPhone App Development User group, Central Ohio iPhone Development User Group (CIDUG). Then last October 2008, I bumped into him in our office as an Agile evangelist mentoring our developers into Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, so on and so forth. I have learnt a lot of Code Management techniques using tools like Subversion, Maven and Hudson (Continuous Integration). Chris is a personable expert of good value. He is a person of high integerity. And he is creative and delivers great results on time. I wish him all the success!\"\n…\nSee more"
