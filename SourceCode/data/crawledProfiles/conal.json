Some highlights:\n\n* Original architect for the DirectAnimation product. Conceived and refined the original design for this powerful media library that integrated audio, video, 2D and 3D graphics and animation. DirectAnimation (originally called \"ActiveVRML\") was the first incarnation of the paradigm that has come to be known as \"functional reactive programming\".\n\n* Fran (http://conal.net/fran), a research system for improving on the ideas explored in DirectAnimation. It introduced and explored declarative specification of interactive animation over a variety of types (2D images, 3D models, sound, and all attributes of these types) in a unified model of continuous-time behaviors and events. Fran has been used in many college courses and has served as the basis of a commercial product, at least four Ph.D. theses, and many follow-up papers. The fundamental ideas have been further applied to robotics, vision, user interfaces and stage lighting control.\n\n* Pan (http://conal.net/Pan), a high-level language and optimizing compiler for image synthesis and manipulation. Worked with three product groups toward integration with their products.\n\n* Vertigo (http://conal.net/Vertigo), a language and compiler for computations on graphics processors. It generates C$\\sharp$ and vertex shader assembly code. Supports procedural geometry and textures and programmable shaders, all in a simple and consistent framework, based on first-class functions.\n\n* Mentored several interns successfully.\n\n…\nsee more",
