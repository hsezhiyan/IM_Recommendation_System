        "text": "Sai has been instrumental in working with the SQL Server team to manage one of the largest TFS installations in the world.  It is a challenging environment because the scale of the server (many 10s of TB) make even simple tasks like branching difficult to execute.  We also are often testing pre-release versions of SQL or TFS on the server in production, adding even more complexity.  Sai has been a great partner in helping to debug hard problems at scale, deal with sometimes \"odd\" requests from the engineering team, and generally being beyond flexible to allow us to push the limits of what the software and hardware can do.  It's a great pleasure to work with someone on such a fun problem space where normal playbooks are often just not written to cover the class of challenges that exist in this environment."
