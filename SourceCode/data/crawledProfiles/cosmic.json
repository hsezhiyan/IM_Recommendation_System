Michele is technically very skilled and very well versed in a number of different areas, such as: Operating Systems, programming languages, GUI tools and especially web-related technologies. He has a very acute interest in developing innovative ways to solve problems, generally based on state of the art technologies. He is always up-to-speed on the best technologies to be used to solve certain classes of problems. His knowledge, which he keeps updating, by gaining access to the best available resources also allows him to successfully mentor younger engineers. He is a good and clear communicator, is extremely personable and well versed in many other disciplines, well beyond his work-related interests. Thanks to his wide experience and training, in my opinion, he is the ideal member of any team that needs somebody able to design complex systems, avoiding any pitfalls and mistakes less experienced and more simple-minded developers might fall into.
