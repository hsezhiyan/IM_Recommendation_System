The products we offer use artificial intelligence to enable brands to automate daily operations and gain significantly higher accuracy demand forecasts.\n\nAs Chief Operating Officer, my ultimate goal is to help CPG brands realize lost sales on their P&L and improve working capital drivers on their balance sheet.
