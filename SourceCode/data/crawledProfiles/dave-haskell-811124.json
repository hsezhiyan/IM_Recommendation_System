I reported directly to Dave while at LearnUp and learned as much from him in my 18 months as I had in any role before that. Dave inspired me to be better as a rep and as an employee (overall in a startup). Under Dave I was able to onboard quickly, achieve a lot of success in a structure, and was given the tools, support and motivation to thrive. On top of that Dave led by example - he has impeccable Sales DNA and thrives in complex high value deals. At LearnUp we followed a process (MEDDIC), but had fun doing it. Dave was the driver of that culture and motivated our team to win.\n…\nSee more"
