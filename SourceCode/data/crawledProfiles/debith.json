My favorite language by far is Python, although I have wide experience in other languages too, such as C++ and JavaScript being the strongest ones. Still, I consider programming language to be just one tool to accomplish functional software. In fact, I believe that programming skill is not limited just to languages, but also how to use them and how to use the skills learned in other language and use those same skills in the other. That's why we have test-driven development, frameworks, design patterns and other concepts, that can be mixed together so that we can build a working software. I want to use those tools and concepts to build a software that matters to its users. Quality comes first."
