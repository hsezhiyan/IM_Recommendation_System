He was the strongest asset to the team and he has showcased his excellent project management skills and leadership during the project. Even though he had limited business knowledge in the beginning, Keong bravely volunteered to take lead to write the business proposal for the project. One could only imagine the countless hours he spent on improving his knowledge and polishing the business plan. Keong’s effort was indispensable in our success in the Clean Energy Challenge. Even well after the conclusion of the competition, Keong was did pro bono work to create a website for the project, further raising awareness of it. This once again shows his versatility and his commitment to whatever he works on. If I am given the chance again, I will definitely choose to work with Keong.\n…\nSee more"
