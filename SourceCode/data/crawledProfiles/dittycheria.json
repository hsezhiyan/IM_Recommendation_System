Dan was the first full-time attorney and was able to scale the legal team as the business rapidly grew. Dan's impact was clearly seen in fundraising, IP protection, complex business matters, IPO readiness, and negotiating a complex M&A transaction on the heels of a pending IPO.  Through it all Dan never lost his composure or his humility -- he always provided sound strategic and business advice in a timely manner, and he is one of the easiest people to collaborate with. Dan has enormous upside ahead of him. It will be fun to watch where his career takes him. I hope to be lucky enough to have the opportunity to work with Dan again in the not so distant future."
