Doron came on board as an SDR, and while the world around him was shifting and changing, he kept his priorities and his goals straight – at one point carrying the whole SDR Lead quota by himself – and he was of course quickly tapped to build a new team and turn up the heat. He built and led a high-output, high-touch team that has kept the leads coming, to the delight of everyone who sits later in the funnel. All while doing this, Doron always has a positive attitude, a curious mind, and follows up on every promise he makes. And he always does it with a smile, willing to help everyone through the toughest of days. In other words, I'd happily recommend Doron – he rocks! But I told you that already, didn't I?\n…\nSee more"

Over that time period, I witnessed Kevin get involved in every area of the business - there was no problem too small or too big - and immerse himself in understanding that unit's challenges. He rolled up his sleeves and got involved in fixing the immediate issues as well as implementing a strategic vision, only moving on when the job was done. Kevin was also focused on our personal development and gave generously of his time to discuss our career paths, our business ideas, and feedback in general. Kevin was instrumental in my growth as an employee and as a person and I can't recommend him highly enough."

The product that we sold was complex, and the messaging difficult to nail down, but Michael's ability to take complex ideas and communicate them in easy to understand and succinct messaging, helped us achieve and surpass our lead generation goals. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, he is an absolute pleasure to be around, and a natural leader. He inspired a team to overcome obstacles and exceed the business's expectations. I highly recommend him to any company."
