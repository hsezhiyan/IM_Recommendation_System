I can’t recommend him highly enough. He has always met or exceeded expectations on his assigned tasks. Greg and I were both members of the same teams for the last 6+ years at Nestle. Four years with the Nestle GLOBE Interface Competency Center and 2 with Nestle Purina Pet Care’s Middleware Interface team. In that time I consider him to be the best team member I worked with locally in Saint Louis. One thing that stood out in our working relationship was Greg’s consistent willingness to answer questions on tasks that I was struggling with. His tenure at Nestle exceeded 25 years and I think that speaks for itself when it comes to his dedication to Nestle and the IT roles he has held in that time. For me the best attribute that Greg always showed, was his desire to make sure the customer was satisfied with his work or information he provided. This resulted in consistent favorable feedback from the teams and customers we supported. I highly recommend Greg for any positions that you may be considering for him.\n…\nSee more"
