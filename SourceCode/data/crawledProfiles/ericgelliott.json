Not only does Eric bring JavaScript experience to the table, but the breadth of his knowledge is evident as the conversation winds from testing to new trends such as hypermedia APIs to code paradigms. Additionally, Eric was always available for questions on JavaScript & Node.js development and offered outstanding advice freely.

He knows the language inside and out, and stays up to speed (and occasionally pushes the boundaries himself) with the latest design patterns, best practices and useful libraries. At Tout, he helped put our JavaScript architecture on a much firmer foundation, standardizing around a core set of abstractions, which were then implemented in code, that will serve us well for a long time to come. I look forward to the day we can work together again.\n…\nSee more"

Frank Ocean, Usher, and Metallica to name a few.\r\n\r\nJason is also a great collaborator, and his talent and work ethic are motivational and inspiring to other team members. His ability to balance creative aesthetics and technical implementation makes him a tremendous asset -- particularly if you need to prototype and get a product to market quickly.
