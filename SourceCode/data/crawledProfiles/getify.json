Kyle was with us when we switched to Agile methodology. His experience and guidance was absolutely essential in making our transition work. Kyle challenged us to think beyond just written dogma, and refused to let us be complacent on challenging issues that we faced. Even though we worked on different engineering teams, seeing how Kyle worked helped me become a better programmer.\n…\nSee more"

He is flexible and works on whatever tasks the team needs, and manages multiple priorities very well.\r\n\r\nHe is a very strong asset to any development team, and was great to work with, not only as a developer but also as a friend. I would highly recommend him, and it would be a pleasure to work with him again."
