Not only did she make me feel confident in my abilities as an Account Director, she helped me refine and learn new skills that would empower me to maximize my success during my tenure. This was my first sales role in my career; Gigi re-defined what a sales person meant and allowed me to see the self-gratification of my achievements -- what you put into your position is truly what you will get out of it. Gigi is a natural. She sees a need and is able to clearly define a solution, and has the patience to work with her team on how to get there. Gigi and I built a friendship outside of our working relationship -- I respected her ability to keep business as business and not allow that to interfere with any outside engagements. She made me feel rewarded and accomplished throughout my successes, and offered the right type of criticism and feedback when she noticed my areas of weakness.

He was new to sales when he came on but due to his drive, maturity, intelligence and desire to both learn and teach those around him he quickly became a top performer and leader amongst his peers. During his time on my team I watched him move through 3 different roles, all with a high level of ambiguity, and excel in each due to his adaptability and keen problem solving skills. My advice to anyone who has the opportunity to work with Ayan, whether a customer or employer, jump on it!"
