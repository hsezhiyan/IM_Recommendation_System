Previously, I worked at Organic Motion as the primary developer of the OpenStage SDK and BackStage client software. I am also the developer of CMake Tools for Visual Studio, an open source Visual Studio extension providing syntax highlighting and IntelliSense for CMake. I hold the degrees of Master of Science and Bachelor of Science, both in computer science, from Columbia University and Yale University, respectively. My undergraduate program also included extensive coursework in mathematics. Prior to beginning full-time work, I completed an internship at Fog Creek Software. I also have experience in academic research and open source development."
