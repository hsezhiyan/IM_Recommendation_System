Chris and I share major research interests in GPCRs both their role in pathophysiology and their utility as drug targets. Chris has always impressed me as a highly intelligent and thoughtful scientist who has an incredibly broad range of knowledge. His insights into disease process and his interdisciplinary knowledge make him an excellent scientist. His knowledge is not only theoretical; he has very practical hands-on laboratory skills that he has applied to many immunology projects, both as Team Leader and as member. At Berlex Chris has served on various committees for example the Scientific Advisory Committee where he consistently makes valuable contributions and suggestions. In addition he has chaired various working groups and has been a group leader on a number of very challenging projects all of which have benefited from his scientific leadership and mentoring. He is a good supervisor and mentor both to his direct reports and also to other more junior staff. Chris is an excellent team player and contributes across the board at all levels. He has first class communication skills that enable him to effectively get the message across with ease. Chris Haskell’s easygoing manner great personality and leadership skills mark him as a prized individual that any organization could count itself lucky to have.\n…\nSee more"

As with many research organizations, the laboratory staff was constantly requiring room modifications and upgrades, as well as ordering equipment that required integration into the labs.  Alex and his team were right on top of these projects, providing excellent service.  His group maintained the overall equipment and environment with the highest regard for safety, efficiency, and dependability.  Alex would be an asset to any organization."

John is a gifted leader, able to get the most out of a team. John also has a keen analytical ability.  He can take a complex problem, break it down into its component parts and determine the critical path activities for solution.  What made it most enjoyable to work with John was that he is a scientist always striving to understand the core mechanisms involved in disease pathology.  John has a drive to get the job done, and I hope to be able to work with him again."
