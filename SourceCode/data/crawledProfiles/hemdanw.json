During that time, Wael demonstrated exceptional product knowledge, technical knowledge, leadership, and dedication to his work. For example, when a critical customer was in need of support in Malaysia, we called on Wael to fix their problems on site. When Wael decided he was going to be part of the DSP software team at Teradyne, he signed up for a graduate course at MIT and aced it. Those are just two examples, but I could provide many. Given the opportunity I would gladly work with Wael again.\n…\nSee more"
