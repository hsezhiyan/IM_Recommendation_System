The Gaussian Copula approach was used to model dependencies between individual PPI indices.\nMigration of the economic model “Equity Investments Portfolio Value at Risk”, initially implemented in MATLAB by the bank quantitative analysts, into the standard compliant C++ 11/C++14 language. The model involved implementation of the revaluation, and subsequent VaR estimation of a linear correlated portfolio of equities, at a specified value of risk percentile. The Monte Carlo simulation approach was used to obtain the distribution of the P&L of the portfolio. In this model (as well as in the model above) the Gaussian Copula approach was used to model dependencies between individual elements (equities) of the portfolio.\n…\nsee more",
