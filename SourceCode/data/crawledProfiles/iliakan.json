He's dedicated, knowledgeable, always ready to help in case of an emergency (which never happens when he's in charge). If one wants to have a rock-stable service, Alexey is the right guy to do it. Alexey knows a *lot* about other networking and web-development stuff too. I cannot list all the technologies that Alexey knows here, cause there's a bunch. Really. Alexey a great Project Manager as well. His broad knowledge allows him to really understand what's going on, suggest features, participate in discussions and easily manage the team. If he takes something to do, he does it really good. *Thumbs up*, Alexey! P.S. (in another language) Лёша отличный админ и гуру по пачке технологий.
