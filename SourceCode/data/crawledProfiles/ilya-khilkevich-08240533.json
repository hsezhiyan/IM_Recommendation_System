As an established professional from Russia who had just come to the country, I needed a qualified instructor with knowledge of both Russian and American cultures for me to pick up some vocabulary and improve my conversation skills in certain topic such as job interview, business meetings, etc. After the evaluation test, both oral and written, we worked out a curriculum for our session. I enjoyed our lessons and learned a lot as well. Lubov is an experienced language instructor who can easily adjust the lesson according to the student’s needs and learning pace. Expect some homework, too but in reasonable quantities and it’s the stuff you really need… I would highly recommend Lubov!\n…\nSee more"
