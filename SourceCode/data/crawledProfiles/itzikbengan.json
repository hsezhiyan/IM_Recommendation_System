I was just getting started as a database professional and his training left a significant impression on me. His wealth of knowledge and genuine desire to help others learn was extremely exciting for me. It's rare to see someone this talented still be able to teach concepts in such a practical way. I can honestly say that I have continued to find ways in which to apply what I learned in those classes. Whether it's developing some queue logic or evaluating index design, I still reference his books regularly. On top of the extensive knowledge he shares, Itzik truly helped grow my ability to problem solve and approach things logically. In short, Itzik has my respect and appreciation as a phenomenal teacher that played a large role in the direction my career took. I gained applicable knowledge, developed a hunger for more, and left inspired to take things to the next level. Thank you, Itzik!\n…\nSee more"
