I am hoping to expand it and make more games for the app store, though its hard when you are the one making the website, the graphics, the code, the logos, and the ads, it seems impossible. Its a long process for me, especially with school in the way. Because I'm only 10 years old, its also very hard but fun. I live in NM Sandia Park, with my mom, dad, and two sisters."
