Jamie had to oversee several aspects of this project and was always on top of his game. He was responsible for 32 sub contractors and making sure they invoiced the proper amounts each and ever month for over 2 1/2 years. If that wasn't enough he took care of all the procurement responsiblities and made sure all charges to the project hit the correct task each month. The level of detail that Jamie provide to this project was outstanding and I was very proud to work with such a deddicated person.

Not only is Mr. Holt knowledgeable within the Accounting field but is always willing to pass on his knowledge to coworkers/employees which always results in a bettering of his department. He is very precise and wonderful with time management giving him a reputation of being \"on top of things\". His best skill I would say is his ability to recognize business solutions and take the initiative to implement them successfully. Terry supported a 4 project Design/Build Construction Program totaling well above $300+ Million in revenue, mostly by himself.  In short, I would say that Mr. Holt is an Accounting professional that any company would be fortunate to have on staff."
