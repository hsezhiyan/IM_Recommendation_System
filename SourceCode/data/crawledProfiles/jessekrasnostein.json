As the company was rapidly growing, Jesse played a pivotal role in nearly all aspects of the company's operation. From product to account management to operations to basically anything in between, Jesse was a vital part of the team and the growth of the company. Jesse has a very well tempered manner to him that makes it easy for virtually any human being to get along with. Jesse always comes in with a good attitude, and is the kind of person that looks at a problem with the approach of \"how am I going to solve it?\" vs. \"this can't be done.\" Overall, I think I speak for the entire organization in saying I very much enjoyed the time I spent with Jesse at Spotad; and I do hope one day that our paths do cross again. He stays a good friend to this day. Feel free to contact me directly if you would like any more specifics on Jesse's time at Spotad.\n…\nSee more"

He was the galvanizer that allowed the business to reach profitability at such an early stage.  \r\n\r\nMike is nothing short of a hyper growth expert. He has a relentless and incredibly positive attitude, he commits fully to execution, and he doesn’t stop until he smashes past his goals. It is these characteristics that would make him an incredibly valuable asset to any organization that is lucky enough to work with him. \r\n\r\nMike is also incredibly values driven. He has an innate sense of what is right, and will always do his utmost to ensure his work has a positive impact on those that it touches. \r\n\r\nOverall, I think very highly of Mike, and I enjoyed our time at Spotad immensely.
