He's eager to please and is deftly skilled at interpreting often ambiguous concepts. He works well on his own and can be counted on to deliver first class projects on time. His opinions and suggestions are often right on the money and when at times I feel they are not, he has a keen awareness and sensitively to step back and give me time to realize he was right in the first place. This alone is quite a skill as I can be very difficult to work with and at times fancy myself the Anna Wintour of the company. I know Jesse will be massively successful in his endeavors throughout his life and I will always feel honored to have spent time working with him. Jesse has my highest recommendation and respect.\n…\nSee more"
