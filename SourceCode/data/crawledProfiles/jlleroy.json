An aspect of the project that was both challenging and delightful is that the boundary between the roles of business (my team) and IT (Jean-Louis's team) was highly blurred, with both teams contributing heavily in terms of design, implementation, and ideas. One of Jean-Louis's responsibilities in the project was to ensure that the library code would remain production-level quality (as required for the production of official risk figures), in spite of a significant part of it being contributed by people with no prior background in C++ or structured development methodologies. Jean-Louis was the right person to take this charge, thanks to his deep knowledge in the field, his passion for sharing it, and his talent for making highly technical matters accessible to laypeople, all this combined with an acute ability to think out of the box. Priorities and projects changed with the merger, but I later had many other opportunities of appreciating, through both professional advices and friendly conversations, Jean-Louis's insightful and opinionated (though never dogmatic) views on various programming topics, as well as on general scientific matters.\n…\nSee more"

One of his main achievements during that period was the setup of the grid computing (platform symphony). The first six months 2011, he was involved in the migration of a reporting tool wrote in Borland C++ that we received from the business. Technology used for that was: C# / WPF / MS SQL Server. Next, from mid-2011 until now, he helped us to setup the new development framework and started by making bug fixes and small development in the new Risk Application. He was also a key element by teaching the team and giving us his expertise in C# / WPF / MVVM / Test Driven development. By all these work experiences, he showed he was a real team player with a good communication skills and a great commitment to the deadline requirement of the projects.\n…\nSee more"
