Joel is one of the smartest and most efficient developers I ever met in my entire career. If you think you've met some 10x devs before, wait to work with Joel to recalibrate your eval. His depth of knowledge in so many areas ranging from FE development, CI/CD, automation, to distributed systems with a mix of legacy and new technologies provided my teams and the organization the support and confidence that any project he touched would ship on time. I would hire Joel again without any hesitation, if the opportunity happens to be. Joel, you rock!\n…\nSee more"
