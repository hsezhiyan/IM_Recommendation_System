      "description": "I'm a member of the Drivers team. We build the open source libraries that enable users of all programming languages to use MongoDB in their applications.\n\nI am the lead developer of MongoSwift, the official MongoDB Swift driver. The driver provides an idiomatic MongoDB API for Swift applications running on iOS, tvOS, watchOS, MacOS, and Linux, and works with both traditional and embedded MongoDB (i.e. MongoDB Mobile). I wrote the driver from scratch with the oversight of a lead engineer and continue to maintain it and add new features along with two teammates. Please see the GitHub repo and documentation linked below for more information.\n\nI serve as a mentor to more junior engineers and interns, and speak about Swift and MongoDB at technical conferences.\n…\nsee more",
