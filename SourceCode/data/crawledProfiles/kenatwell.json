He introduced us, the SQE Team, to the SCRUM process, and with his technical expertise he guided us in developing applications that exposed some bugs in the software that would not have been found otherwise. It was a breath of fresh air to have a manager who you could go to and quickly explain a rather complex and technical problem and get either the solution or at least technical guidance. As we would like to say, \"he does not shy away from being in the trenches with the rest of us.\" But above all, he was someone you could count on to remove any road blocks. For instance, if there was some part of the product that was difficult for the SQE team to test, he would push back on the development leads to make the software more testable. Ken's technical expertise, combined with his ability to manage, made working with him a real pleasure. I highly recommend him to any leadership or technical position. Sincerely, Alex Gray\n…\nSee more"

As the most senior member of the team, Nicole was a role model for more junior team members. She instilled strong organizational skills, detail-oriented thinking, and a strong work ethic.\n\nHer willingness to adapt and take on new challenges, even something well outside of our “comfort zone” was always appreciated. This made her my go-to member of the team when there was some task that didn’t quite fit in our team’s roles but nevertheless needed to be done. This sometimes led her into successful cross-functional engagements with diverse stakeholders and interests.\n\nI can imagine that Nicole can be successful in a diverse set of job responsibilities and work environments."

From new machine deployment, off-site backups, systems migration, to maintenance of our multiple-boot QA lab environment, Scott operated with a large degree of independence, practically a one-man show.  During those years, I cannot think of a single instance when one of our business-critical systems was down for any appreciable length of time.  I recommend Scott to anyone looking for reliable system administration."
