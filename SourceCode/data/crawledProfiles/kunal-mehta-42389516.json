We were responsible for terabytes of sensitive financial information and an \"Oops\" moment was simply disastrous for the DBA team. Kunal made all efforts on his part to make sure that things function smoothly. When they did not, he was quick to address the issues so that the the ripples were absorbed as quickly as possible. Anything from scripting daily DBA tasks, to working with other teams to create documentations and facilitate training, Kunal was willing and able to help. He trained and managed the offshore database team almost single-handedly when we were short staffed at several key time periods. His skills as a DBA are extremely valuable, his will to grow, and the ability to stay level headed during times of stress will be an asset to any organization. A 5 star DBA with a sense of humor! Highly recommended.\n…\nSee more"
