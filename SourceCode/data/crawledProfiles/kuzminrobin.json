        "text": "I've been working with Robin since he served as a volunteer at C++Now in May of 2016. Most C++Now volunteers are thirsty for C++ knowledge, but Robin distinguished himself in that, in addition to technical knowledge, he was particularly conscientious about his assignments as a volunteer. He was ready, even eager, to learn how the conference was run and to take on more responsibilities leading to a transition from volunteer to staff. Robin is currently the Speaker Liaison for both C++Now and CppCon, the oldest and largest C++ conferences in the world, respectively. At both conferences he has taken on a number of other duties, most related to the conferences' technical content. His primary role, that of Speaker Liaison, is both very important to the conference and very time consuming for the liaison. In addition to sending out information updates to all conference speakers, Robin is responsible for responding to the scores of questions and requests that we get every year from speakers, many of whom have not spoken at a conference before and some of whom make wrong assumptions about how these conferences are run. In order to answer these questions and intermediate between speakers and other conference staff, Robin needs to know a lot of detail about how the conferences are run and I'm impressed that he can have learned all of that for both conference in so short a time. Like all the best software engineers, Robin is detail oriented and in addition he is extremely conscientious and reliable. It makes my job as conference chair so much easier when Robin volunteers to take something on, because I know that it will be done and done right. I'm impressed with Robin not just because he is a team player, executing on the plans developed (with his consultation) by the conference manager, but also because he's shown what he can do on his own. Robin recognized that there is a wealth of C++ videos available, but almost all are in English and, except for the auto-subtitling on YouTube (which is awful for tech videos), these videos have no subtitles and no translations. He saw a need and went after it. He created and has led the C++ Video Access Project to recruit, train, and coordinate volunteers to provide captioning and translation of C++ Videos. The C++ community owes a lot to Robin and I look forward to seeing how his leadership will continue to shape the community's future.\n…\nSee more"
