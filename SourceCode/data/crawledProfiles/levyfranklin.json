With the many Government changes that had taken place, the company was in the process of transitioning to a TPA with all our Health and Dental administration. Frank played a MAJOR role in setting up our internal system to integrate with our TPA. Frank took on the task of setting up all the fields, and organizing all the file feeds that DTB had to transmit on a daily or monthly basis. He was also vital in providing all necessary information for the TPA to complete all reports and remain compliant with all state and federal laws. The integrity and privacy of the information that needed to be transmitted was always first and foremost the concern. Frank's attention to detail, his continued knowledge in researching all security issues; coupled with his ability to express any concerns; is really what aided in the success of this project. I worked with Frank daily. I considerr Frank a subject matter expert in any IT position. He is a great asset to all his business partners and would bring value add to his next career opportunity.\n…\nSee more"

Many times Frank created entire systems (and databases) to automate Human Resources requirement. He would interview the necessary parties involved, review all the documentation, design and code the resulting system. Frank would also revise the systems as required. Frank went above and beyond to understand the laws that we are required to adhere to. Recently, Frank was responsible for creating an annual comprehensive spreadsheet containing the company’s Affirmative Action data to be submitted to our vendor in order to help us prepare our Affirmative Action Plan which is required by the federal government for federal contractors. I understand this involved merging several different sources of information and it was done to flawlessly. Frank always ended up saving our HR Department a lot of manual work and a lot of time. I always found Frank easy to work with and he always understood each step of the law as I explained it to him for his job to done thorough and to perfection. Frank would always take things a step further and ask, \"what if...\",which was a tremendous help when dealing with such detailed work. Frank is extremely detailed and has an astonishing amount of knowledge to assist in HRIS projects.\n…\nSee more"
