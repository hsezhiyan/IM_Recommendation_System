She not only executes on her work, but she has a mind for process and is always vocal about when it can be improved. May doesn't just see problems, she helps to fix them. Whether that is through outlining options to address, or simply proactively initiating the fix in the code. May is a team player. She was always quick to extend a hand to other devs when they needed it: pairing, reviewing pull requests, offering a second opinion. One of the larger projects May was tasked with centered around integrating a 3rd party application into Treehouse's codebase. She was thorough and intentional about documenting the integration and her own work. Because of that, she made it easy for other team members to integrate and provide assistance as needed. She regularly met or exceeded her commitments on the project. It was assuring as her manager to know that she would thoughtfully and consistently execute on her work.\n…\nSee more"

Throughout our acquaintance, May has demonstrated a high level of accountability by understanding business drivers and our numbers, owning and learning from her mistakes, and owning her inputs and results. She is also a hard worker, honest in her doings, earns and extends trust, and is an overall awesome collaborator. For example, May not only goes into deep level critical thinking type conversations about things, but she reads the room and the personalities of others then makes accommodations in her communication style in effort to collaborate better. May was actively involved in mentoring sessions, and was throughly engaged in increasing her technical skill set. She consistently delivers on time and her deliverables are always accepted upon first delivery. May asks the right questions about her work, and at the most appropriate time. May has a deep need to discuss and analyze new information, but some of her teammates do not. As a result, May reads the room and responds appropriately by going into deep discussion and analysis with others who also want to do this, and limiting her questions and discussion when others don't find this comfortable. May collaborates with the team about problem and solutions both in person and via Slack. She verifies her understanding of deliverables before getting too far into them which would result in rework.   May is a highly accountable, hard working collaborator who has been a pleasure to manage and interact with. I hope to have the opportunity to work with her again in the future.\n…\nSee more"

He was juggling many responsibilities at the time including serving as Director of Design, managing the engineering marketing team and its members, and contributing as a designer. Despite having so many competing responsibilities that pulled him in many different directions, he always seemed totally focused on the task at hand and was able to give each item his whole attention. He managed the team well and worked hard to ensure the developers and designers on the team could focus solely on getting work done. He was always open for feedback and looked for ways to improve our team process. He also found little ways to encourage team bonding and bring the team together, which is so important for a remote team."
