As the company grew, Meghan was able to flex her vast skills to help with demand generation, education and now sales operations.

Even though the company had less than 20 people, she had already created one of the largest open source software communities at the time, a huge force that was pushing Mongo up with exponential trajectory. In the following years she continued fostering the community, strategized our marketing, and organized events with massive success - most competitors thought we had a marketing army when it was just a handful of great people she led. She is one of the most hard working and dedicated person I have even seen, and she really cares about people and the community. I hope to have the chance to work with her again!\n…\nSee more"

She has not only done a great job of building a community of developers interested in MongoDB, but she is a huge part of why the tech community in New York City is what it is today. Meghan keeps more groups and conferences organized than most people can attend, and somehow manages to find time to learn new skills and share her experiences.\n…\nSee more"

        "text": "10gen and MongoDB's rise to be one of the most popular products in the non-relational database space is in great part due to Meghan's undying effort to reach out to the developer community and convert users to advocates. In the open source world, the popularity of a product is determined by how easy it is to use, how well it accomplishes its goals, and how highly users and developers speak of it. The latter -- and by far not the least -- of these properties is something Meghan relentlessly delivered for 10gen. Meghan gets developers, and understands that they can react badly to \"being sold\" -- instead, her focus was on enabling programmers to accomplish great things, and then helping them promote to their work to their peers at meetups, conferences, and on the web. During my time at 10gen, the community marketing team grew from just Meghan to a team of 7, with Meghan at the helm. At many companies, this sort of growth can be difficult, but Meghan handled the transition with grace and poise. As the company and MongoDB's user base grew, the efforts of the community marketing team never faltered. 10gen now has community advocates throughout the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, helped along by the community team at 10gen. Though I did not work on her team, I suspect that they would agree that Meghan is a fair and supportive manager. She is thoughtful in her decision-making process, and effectively balances exploration of new opportunities with support of existing priorities. In short, Meghan is an exceptional colleague -- I would eagerly go to work with Meghan again.\n…\nSee more"

She is direct but patient, intelligent but warm, and driven but thoughtful. I have loved working with her. One thing I particularly like about Meghan is her willingness to challenge the comfortable routines of the company, some of which she helped to instigate in the first place. She has pushed us to think differently about how we communicate our message, and has looked beyond 10gen's traditional strength with developers to also think of line of business and Operations executives. Despite being one of 10gen's earliest employees, I have never felt that Meghan rests on her laurels. Each day, she demands more of herself and those around her, without being obnoxious about it. She's a great person and someone I'd work with again.\n…\nSee more"

Her support of the MongoDB community has been a key driver to MongoDB's widespread adoption. Through her extraordinarily effective outreach work with user groups, MongoDB conferences, and the Masters of MongoDB program, she has spearheaded the marketing efforts at 10gen. Without her contributions, it is certain in my mind that MongoDB would not enjoy its leadership position in the NoSQL ecosystem, nor would it enjoy the legions of developers who promote MongoDB within their own organizations. It's hard to overstate her contributions to 10gen's success. I cannot recommend her highly enough.\n…\nSee more"
