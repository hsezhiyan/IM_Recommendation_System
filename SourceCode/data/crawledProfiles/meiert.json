Jens' has been a great inspiration, a teacher and leader during my journey of learning frontend code and webs standards, his mindset of looking at technical challenges holistically without bias is aspirational. He often takes into consideration things that could easily be sidelined, for example best practices, maintainability, latency and quality. Meticulous and very pragmatic; Jens’ has away about him, his ability to take vast amount of data, opinions and insights – consolidate them and develop precise structure for the future – often the distant future – and then strategies for producing the changes. Often leading with example; developing automated computed solutions, that minimize human errors, burden and inefficiency. Doing what's right, not what is easy; I admire Jens thoughtful and selfless approach to doing the right thing for the greater good, even if that means more time and effort in the short term. The scope of this includes his work, in making sure correct web standards are being applied, then making sure the team understands them, all the way through to his own interpersonal development, all of which require, patience, resilience and integrity.\n…\nSee more"

While at Google, he consistently had a strong, positive impact on a large number of projects over many years (including numerous large-scale, complex projects that included stakeholders across multiple organizations and locations). He worked tirelessly to complete projects to perfection while also supporting others in their efforts. He is proactive and consistently seeks out ways to improve himself while also helping others to learn and grow. He not only learns quickly, he is also then able to provide some of the highest standards of follow-through that I've ever seen. Specifically to his web coding skills, he has a deep understanding of HTML+CSS and wrote code of the highest quality (accessible, fast, and maintainable). Jens is someone you should want to work with: He is very productive, executes to the highest of standards, is proactive, takes ownership as a leader, and is very reliable. He is someone I could always trust with any project while being a strong role model for anyone on a team.\n…\nSee more"
