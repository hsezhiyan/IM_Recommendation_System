        "text": "Mike and I were colleagues at Newgistics and although we were not members of the same department, we collaborated-on and executed many projects together. My role as a Transportation Manager required implementing changes to the network, which required changes to business management tools and systems of record, and Mike was a key player in writing the scripts and implementing the code for such changes. During my 12 year tenure at my current employer I've interacted with Mike and many other developers while working on projects and through the process I have never understood the various coding languages, such as SQL, which I've witnessed while collaborating with them. However, this year I decided to take the plunge and advance my data analytics skills by leveraging Mike's experience, and his consulting skills, through the form of a T-SQL mentoring course. Mike helped me to dive headfirst into the world of SQL and gain a fundamental understanding of the language. Mike was very flexible in setting a course schedule to fit my personal needs and we were able to meet twice a week for about 1.5 hours at a time via an online session, where I was able to observe his training tools, demos, etc. and interact at a very personal level with him, along with a small group of classmates. Thankfully, these days I'm able to work in SQL on a regular basis by writing and executing queries as well as interact with developers and actually have a solid understanding of the information we review together. I couldn't say thanks enough... but I'll say it anyway... Thanks Mike!\n…\nSee more"

Mike brings a world of database expertise to the table that is quite addictive to managers and fellow technical staff. The first thing I did when Mike retired from Newgistics was to line him up as a contractor and keep him contributing to our success. I have now used Mike on more projects than I can remember and he always delivers. I never bring in Mike for the easy stuff. Because of his skill set we use him for some of our most complex SQL projects. Mike has a solid reputation with our business managers and our technical staff and we are always confident he will get the job done. I highly recommend him for SQL training, any SQL development and project management. Just don't use him to much as I still need him.\n…\nSee more"
