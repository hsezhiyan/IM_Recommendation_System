        "text": "Monica worked for me as a co-op on two occasions, in the Fall of 2002 and again in the Summer of 2003. The first term, Monica supported my HyperTracer team, developing and debugging C++ programs and perl scripts. HyperTracer is a tool developed by the HyperTracer team to regenerate the exact instruction stream (typically 300 to 400 million instructions) that was executed by a target platform. The team had to hide memory from the operating system, stop the cpu at a user-specified time, dump the system state, set up a special tracking mode which would send tracking information to a memory buffer, then dump the buffer to file, and regenerate the instruction stream via a software model of the cpu. Monica wrote some of the scripts we used to transfer data between machines for a post-processing farm and some of the programs used to hide memory from the system. On her second term, Monica worked on evaluating the performance of SpecJBB. Her assignment was to evaluate SpecJBB’s performance to extrapolate the benefits of either doubling the L2 cache or adding a second cpu core. Monica completed the analysis and generated a report of her findings for AMD which was also used for her thesis. Monica successfully completed the tasks involved with both of her terms. It was good to have her back for a second term. She is self-driven, resourceful, personable, and accepts responsibility well. She was a valuable asset to the team.\n…\nSee more"
