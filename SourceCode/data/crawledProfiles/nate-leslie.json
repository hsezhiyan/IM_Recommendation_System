We built a relationship based on fearless feedback and open communication and I take these two values into all of my relationships, both personal and professional. My career would not be where it is without her guidance.\r\n\r\nI looked forward to every day at New Relic in large part to Sarah, I always enjoyed sharing a laugh or jumping into the 'trench' with her.
