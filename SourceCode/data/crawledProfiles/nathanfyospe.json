He is one of the few engineers that I can honestly say I would go out of my way to work with again."

As core team lead, she is remarkably good at keeping an extremely maverick group of developers pointed in the right direction, even in the face of countless interruptions and issues from other teams, and the chaos of bringing a fifteen year old legacy code base up to modern standards. As a developer, Cleo is both knowledgeable and sharp, and prior to taking over the team leadership role for the core libraries group, was able to salvage the development of (read, completely rewrite, in an unreasonably short time frame) our omega product, finally bringing it out of its perpetual status of complete failure. We rely heavily on her skills in analysis of complex bugs and in code quality management. Cleo is the one who keeps the most reckless of our developers from shooting their own (and the rest of our) feet off. She's also the one that keeps me (the team guru and core architect) from forgetting where I put my feet... without her, I would not be nearly as effective."
