Rather than just any Haskell, I dropped him in at the deep end as our GHC compiler hacker. He was able to implement a number of GHC extensions, mostly in the parser/desugarer, but some which involved the type checker, and work with the community to get them upstream. Shayne took on the challenge of GHC and learnt Haskell at the same time - no mean feat. Shayne is a genuine \"nice guy\" who has made the office a more pleasant environment. I look forward to our paths crossing again in future.\n…\nSee more"

Paul was relentless in taking our raw thoughts and ideas, polishing them, and giving it an overarching story that matched the company message. Paul managed to serve as an effective conduit to communicate complex engineering topics into a business-friendly message, and also served as a valuable sounding board to get the perspective \"from the other side\". Throughout, Paul always stayed away from the limelight himself, leaving others to pick up the credit - an admirable trait.\n…\nSee more"
