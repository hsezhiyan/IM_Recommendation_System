I also specifically remember when shared a series of e-mails to a number of us about using VxWorks more than just in passing as most of us did at that time - in our department, we often used VxWorks BSPs to help us more fully test debugger components, but little more than that - so he is not only highly technically competent, but always happy to engage and share what he knows. He was great as a developer before finding a home in tech support, and there he managed a group that was easy to deal with and always came to me with as much information on a problem as they could gather, making my job a little easier."

My diverse experience includes software development tools, embedded systems, device drivers and diagnostics, and I have impacted multiple components of software products.\n\nMy experience includes low-level software that required knowledge of microprocessors down to the bus cycle and signal level, as well as object-oriented software that is hardware agnostic. I have also thrived in non-technical aspects such as documentation or presenting a new development to a group of people.\n\nI have extensive experience with C that includes low-level programming, object-oriented C++ and Linux that includes dealing with the kernel as well as system programming. In addition, I have authored a wide range of technical documentation, from user manuals to software generation documents.\n\nSkills:\nOperating Systems: Windows 7, Solaris, Linux (Fedora, Ubuntu)\nProgramming Languages: C, C++, Unix/Linux shell script, Tcl, SQL, C#, Java, Perl, Python, Assembly (M68K, PowerPC)\nApplications/Tools: Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse, Visual SlickEdit, ClearCase, SVN, CVS, Qt, git\nOther technologies: National Instruments LabWindows and TestStand, Agilent and Tektronix logic analyzers, HP3458A DVM"
