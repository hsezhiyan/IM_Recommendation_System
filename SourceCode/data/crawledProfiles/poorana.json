Ajay's approach to his Quality Assurance Lead role challenged certain artificial “thought boundaries” which were in place, and he substantially improved the effectiveness of the QA in Optum. He never lets inexperience get the better of him, as he expands his own boundaries to achieve his goals. A strong quality and Automation champion, he sets the bar for others on his team with innovative thinking, improved processes, and the constant drive for delivering quality products. He not only garners technical respect from his work, but he also brings wit and humor to the team, making him a pleasure to work. I'll be happy to work with him in the future.\n…\nSee more"
