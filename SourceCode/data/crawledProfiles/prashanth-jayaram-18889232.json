I collaborated with him, over the course of several years, while curating content for the technical journal SQL Shack Prashanth authored more than 100 articles for SQL Shack, each at least 1,000 words in length. Each article of his passed a rigorous technical review, keyword optimization and thorough copy editing before getting published. His content now ranks in the top 10 search results for hundreds of very competitive and highly searched keywords, and many rank in the top 3 or even first. His content is viewed by hundreds of thousands of site visitors every month. Prasanth worked effectively with our content marketing team from concept, submission, review and publishing. Throughout the process he was extremely diligent in following procedures, responsive to any and all questions and proactive in sourcing high value topics. His velocity, consistency and production was amazing and often created challenges in processing the volume content he created (a good problem to have). I personally worked with Prashanth on a series of articles where we had to solve a technical problem with a combination of tools, SQL and PowerShell. From this, he created a series of authoritative articles but also provided valuable feedback on improvements and optimizations of the underlying technology, which we later implemented In addition to writing content, we hired Prashanth to provide consulting and advice to our product teams to improve their technical solutions. In one case, he duplicated the technical approach to a problem one of our tools solved but did it in a way that was exponentially faster. In this way, he helped isolate a design flaw and was even able to adroitly advise us on how to fix it. Prashanth's strengths, that I valued the most, were his technical acumen, extremely high level of productivity, communication and responsiveness and how effectively he performs in a fast paced and dynamic team environment\n…\nSee more"
