The quest for elegance has brought me two new hobbies: hang gliding and rock climbing.

Before I became lead developer of the Twitch for Android app, its user rating was on a downward trend. It is now rated 4.4 out of 5 cumulative over all versions and continues to rise. As of June, 2014, 1/3rd of Twitch viewers per month watched from mobile. Twitch has 45 million unique viewers per month. App Annie now ranks the Twitch for Android app in the top 400 overall in the Google Play Store for the United States. This places it next to Evernote, Square Register, OkCupid, and Fitbit.\n…\nsee more",
