Although a newcomer to philanthropy and advancement, Rakesh made a significant contribution through his analyses of our phonathon program. He used Tableau to create interactive visualizations and dashboards that enabled the manager of our Phonathon program to quickly assess callers'; completion rates and solicitation success. With this kind of real-time analysis, the manager is able to identify callers who might benefit from more training. Rakesh also used Python to clean and structure all the data before visualizing it. He also visualized acquisition, retention and reacquisition trends and developed a basic predictive analysis model that predicts retention.\n…\nSee more"
