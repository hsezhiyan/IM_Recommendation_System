On top of his rock solid work ethic (first In, last out) he is able to balance both sides of the recruiting equation (if you have worked with recruiters you know how rare this is). On the candidate side - Reuben is able to connect with them personally, understand their situation and be a strong advocate for fit, role and comp. this in term decreases churn and promotes a healthy work culture. On the hiring manager side - Reuben can effortlessly distill the correct requirements for complex roles, minimizing time wasted in resume review. He is able to adapt to the different processes of each hiring manager and pro actively suggest next steps in both the interview and offer steps of the process. This is a dream for hiring managers. We were devastated to see Reuben’s contract end. So much so that the VP of the entire group sent out a memo saying that he is the best recruiter she has ever worked with. If you have any questions on Reuben please feel free to contract me directly. You might have just hit the jackpot.\n…\nSee more"
