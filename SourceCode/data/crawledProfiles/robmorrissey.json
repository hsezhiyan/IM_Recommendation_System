In this time I have seen his skill set grow even further; he is a true open standards developer who can work on full build projects right through from heavy javascript interfaces to complex php back ends. I've also been amazed at how many other super talented people he knows. This is in no small part down to his supremely approachable and affable nature; he is never too busy to take the time to talk knowledgeably about anything development or industry-related. Highly recommended and a great guy.\n…\nSee more"

He also proved himself willing to go beyond the call of duty on a daily basis, in terms of both responsibilities and hours, and was a joy to work with.
