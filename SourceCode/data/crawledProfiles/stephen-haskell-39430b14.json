Stephen's analytical and strategic skills are perfectly balanced with his creativity and communication prowess. He is always smiling, always helping, always making things bigger and better. Stephen's presence and guidance supported me on a daily basis and he was integral to my and our team's achievements. When Stephen announced he was leaving our company I was simultaneously heartbroken and happy, it would simply be selfish to deny others the privilege of collaborating with Stephen. I miss seeing him every day but know that wherever life takes him, and whatever he's working on, countless people are benefiting as a result of knowing Stephen Haskell.\n…\nSee more"
