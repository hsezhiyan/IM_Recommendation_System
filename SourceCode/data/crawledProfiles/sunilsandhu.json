Andy is easy to get along with and does everything in his power to ensure that the trainees and existing staff are,not only comfortable in their job, but also that they are happy in their job. In regards to my own experiences with Andy, he has spent a lot of time helping me in particular with objection handling, call preparation and face-to-face candidate interviews. He is an invaluable asset to Salt and it comes as no surprise that he was voted the company 2010 MVP!\n…\nSee more"
