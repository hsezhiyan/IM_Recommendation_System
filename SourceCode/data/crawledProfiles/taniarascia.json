She challenges herself dig into the guts of development. I'm confident that an employer could task her with recreating or meeting the requirements for just about any web development project and she'd deliver work above-and-beyond the original ask. A real asset to have on any team.\n…\nSee more"

Of course, her technical skills are superb; she picks up new concepts quickly and enthusiastically, with a particular talent for design and clean code. I can personally attest to her skills in HTML/CSS, JavaScript/Node.js, PHP, and back-end server configuration. What I find most impressive, however, is the way she contributes to our chaotic and blossoming field. Her personal website contains an overwhelming amount of in-depth articles, all with a focus on empathy and beginner-friendliness that webdev is sorely lacking. She single-handedly empowers aspiring developers to make websites. How cool is that? For Tania, web development is not a hobby, it's an ongoing passion -- and this passion is nothing short of infectious. Our industry is very lucky to have someone like Tania, and I would recommend her for any team wholeheartedly.\n…\nSee more"

He’s highly competent, detailed, trustworthy, and he cares. Martin succeeded in vastly simplifying the architecture of an existing project, making it easier for newcomers to contribute and reducing busywork and boilerplate. If Martin encounters an issue, he researches diligently to find the best solution, and you can trust that it will be.\n\nAside from that, working with Martin is a lot of fun, so it doesn’t even feel like work in the end."

He’s always willing to jump right in and help, whether or not it’s in one of his areas of expertise. “That’s not my job,” is something you’ll never hear from him. Front end, back end, automation, DevOps - nothing’s off limits for Joe (not even JavaScript!).\n\nJoe has helped me on numerous occasions, whether I’ve needed to set up something new or debug something old, but he doesn’t just quickly take care of it - he gives you the knowledge and tools necessary to do it yourself next time.\n\nI also had the opportunity to pair with Joe on a hackathon project, which was not only fun and challenging for the team, but ended up creating a product that brought a lot of value to the company itself. I’d highly recommend Joe for any automation or software development position."
