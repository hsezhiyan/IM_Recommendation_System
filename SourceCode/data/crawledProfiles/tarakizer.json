Tara would be a contributing member of the design meetings, guiding schema designs and data relationships. Tara has a great deal of knowledge of SQL Server (all versions), and I noticed that she was constantly learning more. She was always willing to lend a hand when issues crop up. And of course she did a great job of doing all the things DBAs do that allow developers not to have to think about the issues involved with keeping a database up, running, performing and highly available. I know that on projects that I was not involved in, Tara was the sole owner of the database, from schema design, to all the stored procedures and queries that the application called, to maintenance and production support of the database.
