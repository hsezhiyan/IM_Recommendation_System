I found Marwa also to be friendly, articulate & a great person to work with & would recommend her to anyone looking for someone professional,workaholic,self-motivated and have excellent leadership skills that include different motivation techniques. I have learnt a lot from her on both technical and non-technical levels.I wish someday we will be able to work together again."
